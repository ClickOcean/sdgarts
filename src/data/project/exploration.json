				"The theme of Oratorium SARXSOMA is loss, different modes of feeling and experiencing sad life events. The premiere of the performance took place on the birthday of the National Center of Contemporary Art. The project was carried out in two formats: theatrical performance, carried out in the space of a specially built large-scale installation, and a video. At Oratorium SARXSOMA, the artists Galina Myznikova and Sergey Provorov combine various types and genres of art: theater, performance, installation, video art and circus.",
				"The visual part of the project takes us to the art of the Middle Ages, Baroque and early modernism, the techniques of which are multiplied with the help of modern technologies. And the sound component of the performance and video \"Oratorio for Two Voices\" was written by composer Daria Zvezdina. Actors of the La Gol Voice Theater Alena Verin-Galitskaya and Daniil Shaposhnik were invited to perform the musical work."

Among them there are performance artists, mixed media masters, conceptual painters, photographers and sculptors. The philosophical treatises of Bacon, Descartes, Kant, Hegel, Husserl, Wittgenstein and other philosophers were presented as artifacts. The contradictions between classical philosophy and contemporary art were removed through the dialogue between artists with thinkers and collectors with curators. Science seeks to know the world with reason, and art - with feelings.",
				"Many art objects from Dmitry Volkov's collection are somehow connected with events from his life. Therefore, the idea of the architecture of the exhibition was to invite visitors directly into the mind of the collector. The viewer followed the prescribed script, and his attention was guided by the audio recording and the light focus, highlighting certain objects from the twilight."

On the other hand, there is a primitive monkey, our wild ancestor bearing secrets of nature and evolution. The image of a modern person who spends his/her days in strict limits was simultaneously reproduced (like OracleTange in a latticework, in the very word sense) and the place of nature in modern civilization was demonstrated. Even the things remained untouched were fenced and safely locked up. Then OracleTang took part in the Festival of Contemporary Art of the Brooklyn Academy of Music Next Wave Art 2015."
